Cullen et al.,Mission support for drones a policy based approach,2017,"“Dull: Tasks with low workload and low intensity such as surveillance over a fixed location. These tasks assume a degree of automation, but without continuous direct control, or sophisticated autonomy, any high-priority opportunity which arises may be missed. Dirty: Operations in environments which are hostile to a manned aircraft or its crew. An example of this would be observation related to chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear detection. Dangerous: Tasks where, for example, there is a high ground to air threat which does not merit the risk to aircrew or soldiers on the ground.”"
Okcu,Utilization of unmanned aircraft systems in maritime domain Challenges and opportunities,2016,"The term dull is used for repetitive and long tasks, which personnel suffer from. Secondly, the term dirty is used for the operation areas, in which personnel cannot enter due to the hazards such as radiation, biological and chemicals agents etc. Finally, the term dangerous means that the operation has great risks for human life."

De Boisboissel,Uses of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems,2015,"“Dangerous: in the case of dangerous threats, it is of the utmost importance to automate certain actions, enabling us to satisfactorily handle several targets, handle a target before it deals with us or before it handles friendly elements. Quick reaction times must prevail. Dull: for extremely repetitive tasks, humans rely on machines with a technology capable of detecting threats or alarms with greater accuracy and steadfastness than any human could ever reach whilst obviating physical tiredness and mental fatigue. In the case of surveillance missions in high risk areas where open access is strictly forbidden (nuclear missile warehouses, No Man’s Land zones, etc.) quick reaction times are also essential. Dirty: it is very strenuous for military units to operate in polluted and contaminated environments as CBRNs4.”"
Gómez-DelaHiz et al.,Joint Optimization of Throughput and Energy Consumption in Microservices-Based UAV Networks,2024,"“[…] triple D ”Dull, Dirty, and Dangerous” which tries to describe their potential and usefulness, since they can substitute other beings in ”dull” (long-lasting, slow or even unimportant activities), ”dirty” (access to volcanoes, agricultural tasks or handling of toxic materials) and ”dangerous” (assistance in natural disasters) activities [3], [4].”"
Fahey and Luqi,Unmanned vehicles for anti-submarine warfare,2016,"“Dull missions tax a human’s concentration, are subject to fatigue forces, and require prolonged vigilance. This mission area is better served by an entity that does not get tired, frustrated, or bored, that will make ‘good’ decisions twenty minutes or twenty hours into a sortie. Dirty missions involve exposure to unhealthy environmental conditions, such as fumes, toxic substances, infectious biological materials or radiation. Entities that are not sensitive to such conditions can perform such missions with  fewer constraints on exposure time.”"
Ozalp and Sahingoz,Optimal UAV path planning in a 3D threat environment by using parallel evolutionary algorithms,2013,"“Dangerous environment term is used for operationally risky areas for both aircrafts and pilots. Dirty defines especially the environment which may be contaminated by chemical, biological, or nuclear particles. Finally, dull is used for tasks, which require long lasting operations, which are not desired to use manned planes.”"

Pascarella et al.,Agent-Based Design for UAV Mission Planning,2013,“Dull operations are too monotonous or require excessive endurance for human occupants. Dirty operations are hazardous and could pose a health risk to a human crew. Dangerous operations could result in the loss of life for the on-board pilot.”
Kutzke et al.,Autonomous robotic re-alignment for face-to-face underwater human-robot interaction,2024,"This is due in part to the benefit of allowing robots to take on the dirty, dull, and dangerous tasks [7] that would otherwise place humans in direct harm or assist in situations in which it is not possible for the human to provide the level of persistent attention required, as in the case of long-term care facilities."
De Sousa and Pereira,Specification and design of coordinated motions for autonomous vehicles,2002,"""Dirty"" refers to reconnoitering areas that may be contaminated, ""dull"" applies t.o surveillance or sentry duty, while ""dangerous"" is related to obvious threats, such as those posed by the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD)"
Hayashi et al.,Are Robots Appropriate for Troublesome and Communicative Tasks in a City Environment,2012,"Dull Task: Endless Guidance: Guidance is one common communicative task in urban environments at large shopping malls and event sites. Providing guidance just once is simple and not so dull; however, it quickly becomes monotonous if the guidance task is endless, e.g., providing continuous guidance for more than a few hours. This situation is actually common. Such tasks are currently assigned to human guides in such situations as special events at amusement parks. Thus, we chose an endless guidance task as an example of a dull task.

Dirty Task: Picking a Key Out of Garbage: In a city, cleaning toilets and garbage collection are typically dirty tasks, some of which are already being done by robots. For them, people naturally prefer robots."
Cakir,2D path planning of UAVs with genetic algorithm in a constrained environment,2015,"The term of dangerous environment is used for operationally risky areas for both aircrafts and pilots. Dirty deﬁnes especially the environment which may be contaminated by chemical, biological, or nuclear particles. Finally, dull is used for tasks, which require long lasting operations, which are not desired to use manned planes."
Guss et al.,Small unmanned aircraft system for remote contour mapping of a nuclear radiation field,2017,"The “dull” aspect refers to repetitive missions. “Dirty” refers to environments in which there are nuclear, biological, and chemical threats. The tasks deemed “dangerous” are those in which there is a high risk to the aircraft and aircrew."
Bartsch,Unmanned and Uncontrolled The Commingling Theory and the Legality of Unmanned Aircraft System Opera,2015,"Any current activity in which airborne assets are deployed in a “dull” (long endurance, high altitude, fatigue inducing), “dirty” (volcanic plumes, chemical spills) or “dangerous” (high risk, low altitude such as firefighting) environment may potentially be conducted in a safer, less expensive, and more efficient manner with unmanned aircraft [3]."
Toledano-García et al.,Trajectory generator system for a UR5 collaborative robot in 2D and 3D surfaces,2023,Dull: The task is repetitive or tedious; Dirty: The task or the environment where it is developed is unpleasant; Dangerous: The task or the environment represents a security risk; Dear: The task is expensive or critical. Dull: The task is repetitive or tedious; Dirty: The task or the environment where it is developed is unpleasant; Dangerous: The task or the environment represents a security risk; 
Carafano et al.,Competitive technologies for national security Review and recommendations,2008,"Dull assignments are those that require routine functions such as monitoring a bridge crossing site. Dirty jobs are performed in harsh environmental conditions, such as searching contaminated areas. Dangerous missions involve tasks in which humans could suffer physical harm, such as disarming an improvised explosive device (IED)."
Clark,"Uninhabited combat aerial vehicles Airpower by the people, for the people, but not with the people",2000,"Dull means long-endurance missions that can last for several hours or even days—too long for a pilot to physically endure. Missions such as extended patrols over no-fly zones would fall into this category, or missions that require long-endurance flights to get to the target area and back would also qualify. Dirty missions are those where the threat of biological or chemical contamination is too high to risk sending in a manned aircraft. Dangerous missions for manned aircraft are numerous and growing; and though most combat missions are dangerous, some are riskier than others."
Salazar et al.,Modeling and real-time stabilization of an aircraft having eight rotors,2008,"Examples include orbiting endlessly over a point for communications relay or jamming (dull), collecting air samples to measure pollution or CW/BW toxins (dirty), and ﬂying reconnaissance over hostile air defenses (dangerous)."

Mochurad et al.,An autopilot-based method for unmanned aerial vehicles trajectories control and adjustment,2024,"Dangerous means that the life of a pilot can be at high risk during the flight. Dirty implies that the operational environment may be contaminated with chemical, biological, or radiation threats, making it unsafe for humans. Dull refers to long-duration, exhausting, and stressful operations that are undesirable for human performance ["
Austin,Robotic rotorcraft,2003,"Dull Roles - Military and civilian applications such as extended surveillance can be a dulling experience for aircrew, with many hours spent on watch without relief, and can lead to a loss of concentration and therefore loss of mission efficiency. Dirty Roles - Again, applicable to both civilian and military applications, monitoring the environment for nuclear or chemical contamination puts aircrew unnecessarily at risk. Dangerous Roles - For military roles, where reconnaissance of heavily defended areas is necessary, the attrition rate of a manned aircraft, with its higher probability of detection, will exceed that of a RR. Powerline Inspection is an example in the civilian field where experience sadly has shown that aircrew are at significant danger."
Deputy,Counterinsurgency and robots Will the means undermine the ends,2009,"The term dull within the three “D”s refers to complacency, or shortcomings in human attention and endurance. "
